    The NHS faces a £22 billion funding shortfall four and a half years from now
    <a

    . That is no longer an abstract number designed to scare the NHS into action. Its reality is hitting home already: a £3.7 billion underlying provider
    deficit in 2015-17, commissioners only balancing their books through one-off, non-recurrent funds, and finally the Department of Health busting its budget
    by £200m despite having made over £1 billion worth of technical adjustments and switches.
    <a
        href="#_ftn2"
        name="_ftnref2"

    >

    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Yet we still know little about how the £22 billion gap will be closed. Regional Sustainability and Transformation Plans are in development – largely behind
    closed doors – and are not due to be completed until October this year. A new “financial special measures” regime is now underway, but that that is an
    attempt to stop the hole getting any deeper, rather than fill it. This analysis is an attempt to set out how the gap might be closed in theory, if things –
    many things - go well, and to raise some alarms about what might happen in practice if they don’t.
</p>

<h2>The trouble with tariff: Or how things went £3.5bn wrong</h2>
<p>
    The huge financial deficit now pervading NHS hospitals and other providers – around £3.7 billion after the smoke and mirrors of one-off accountancy
    adjustments have been removed – is testament to the fact the traditional method of saving NHS cash has ran out of steam
    <a
        href="#_ftn3"
        name="_ftnref3"
        title=""
    >
        [3]
    </a>. That method cannot be put too simply: over the last five years it has boiled down to paying hospitals less – in cash terms – for the same procedure, for
    each year that passes.
</p>
<p>
    The mechanism for doing that was the NHS tariff, which determines a national price for thousands of treatments and packages of care. Every year between
    2010-11 and 2015-16 the tariff was ratchetted down another notch, cutting the cash amount hospitals were effectively paid for each patient by 1.6% a year.
    Factor in NHS-specific inflation, and that was a real terms cut of 3.8%, year after year.
</p>
<p>
    The rationale for that was to drive waste out of NHS providers; to force hospitals and other services to cut their unit costs in order to stay afloat, by
    ensuring their rapidly diminishing income-per-treatment covered the expense of providing that care. That worked for a few years, but by
    2013-14, the pace of provider cost-cutting started to fall behind the pace of the year-on-year cuts to the tariff. To keep up with the cuts in their
    income, providers needed to make a 4% cut in their operating costs every year from 2011-12.
</p>
<p>
    By 2013-14, however, their annual cost-cutting efforts were nearer 2%. As a result that year, a £600m underlying deficit emerged in NHS provider accounts
    <a
        href="#_ftn4"
        name="_ftnref4"
        title=""
    >
        [4]
    </a>
    . The following year the underlying deficit more than doubled to £1.5 billion, and then in 2015-16 it more than doubled again. By that year, NHS providers
    were being paid £925 in cash for the same procedure they would have been paid £1,000 to perform in 2009-10, the equivalent of a real terms cut of 20% to
    just £800.
</p>
<p>
    This year, things have had to be different. Forced by the sheer size and unsustainability of the provider deficit, tariff prices have been increased, in
    cash terms, for the first time this decade. The increase is modest – just 1.8%, which is more than outstripped by the expected inflation in provider costs
    (determined predominantly by salary, drug and equipment costs), but it will at least mean that in order to keep pace with cuts to the tariff, providers
    will only need to find 2% cost cuts a year, rather than the 4% required of late. That will not leave NHS providers laughing, but it should mean their
    deficits will stop increasing as a proportion of their turnover, just as long as they keep up their recent trend of 2% recurrent cost cuts a year.
</p>
<div id="chart1-div"></div>
<p>
    The more significant impact, however, is on NHS commissioners: NHS England centrally, and clinical commissioning groups locally. For them, the main measure
    of their spending power is not simply much how much extra cash they get from the government each year, but what direction cash prices in the tariff are
    moving. When tariff cash prices are cut, commissioner buying power is increased above and beyond the headline increase in their allocations. But when
    tariff cash prices shift upwards, the reverse is true, and commissioner buying power is diminished.</p>
    <p>So while annual increases in NHS commissioner headline cash allocations are set to remain fairly constant over this current decade – averaging 3.1% a year
    from 2009-10 to 2015-16 and 3% in the budgets announced from 2016-17 onwards, the cash increase in tariff prices means that 3% cash increase will translate
    into significantly less buying power than commissioners have been used to: an average of just 2.4% growth a year from 2016-17 onwards, down from an average
    of 4.5% between 2009-10 and 2015-16
    <a
        href="#_ftn5"
        name="_ftnref5"
        title=""
    >
        [5]
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    That is a significant problem for commissioners because demand for hospital and other NHS services is currently growing at 3.1% a year; considerably faster
    than commissioners’ ability to pay for it, this year and beyond.
</p>
<p>
    That means that while measures to curtail NHS spending in the first half of this decade centred almost exclusively on reducing the unit cost of care by
    squeezing ever more efficiencies out of providers, the second half of this decade – and the quest to make £22 billion worth of savings – will see a
    sharpening of the incentive for commissioners to curtail spending by scaling back the quantity of care purchased, and possibly its quality too.
</p>
<h2>Unit costs up + activity up = commissioners go bust?</h2>
<p>
    We can bring this incentive into sharp relief – and explore its potential implications – by calculating the future cost to commissioners and providers of
    NHS care, if the volume of care provided continues to grow at its current rate. These costs can then be compared to the NHS’s commissioning budget up to
    2020-21, to give a measure of their affordability, or otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fyfv-tech-note-090516.pdf">NHS England’s central assumption</a> for activity growth across the NHS as a whole is a continuation of the recent trend of 3.1% a year until 2020-21; that is,
    that NHS hospitals and other services will provide 3.1% more care each year, by treating more patients, with more complications through more intense and
    more advanced medicine.</p>
<p>
    We can calculate how much that growing quantity of care will cost to provide, and how much commissioners will be asked to pay for it, by using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-assumptions-201617-to-202021/economic-assumptions-201617-to-202021 ">guidance
    set out by NHS Improvement on NHS tariff prices to 2020-21</a>.
    
    This shows how much inflation providers are expected to face, how much of that they will be expected to off set through efficiencies (as we have seen, 2%
    from now on) and how much prices will increase for commissioners. Although the tariff only applies directly to secondary care (over two thirds of all NHS
    care) it is reasonable to assume - at least for this headline analysis - that similar cost pressures (staff, drugs, equipment) will apply across all NHS
    services.

</p>
<div id="chart2-div"></div>
<p>
    Chart 3 shows these rising costs and sets them against the NHS commissioning budget to 2020-21, announced as part of the November 2015 Spending Review. We
    display this graph as an index, where costs in 2013-14 are set at 100, and a 10% increase in cost is shown as 110. (A little further below we will look at
    these costs in cash terms, when we zoom in on the secondary care budget, where we are able to be more precise about the relationship between the volume and
    cost of healthcare).

    <div class="text"><hr /><p>To model the cost of future activity we have first established the baseline cash cost of secondary care for each year from 2009-10 to 2014-15. This
            was derived from the NHS Reference Cost dataset, which details the cash cost to NHS hospitals and other secondary care services of providing £75
            billion worth of the total £100 billion annually spent on NHS care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provider and commissioner cash costs for projected activity beyond 2014-15 are calculated by first applying the activity growth rate from the
            2014-15 cash cost to provider and then multiplying the value of activity by either the expected net change in provider costs for the year (ie, the
            product of inflation as defined by the tariff and the 2% efficiency assumption) or the planned net change in tariff cash prices.

            For all years except 2019-20 we have taken our measure of provider inflation from the figures published as part of the NHS tariff (or NHS
            Improvement’s guidance on the future tariff). 2019-20 is the exception because the published figure for provider inflation that year (2%) does not
            include the impact of the change in the public sector pension discount rate announced as part of the 2016 Budget. We calculate that will add
            approximately 0.7% to secondary care provider costs in 2019-20 and so have adjusted the inflation figure for that year from 2% to 2.7% and assumed
            the cost will be passed onto commissioners in the form of a 0.7% increase to tariff rates. We have assessed the
            sensitivity of our analysis to this adjustment which is to increase the size of the reported overall deficit in the secondary care sector by
            2020-21 by approximately £600m. As the size of the projected deficit discussed in almost all our scenarios is far in excess of this sum, the thrust
            of this analysis is unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, as the reference cost dataset covers service cost (£62 billion in 2014-15) rather than full operational cost (£75 billion), values for
            each year are multiplied up to reflect provider full operational costs, net of education and training costs (approximately 3.6%) as those costs are
            typically funded by Health Education England, rather than commissioners. These adjustments are made using the  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-reference-costs-2014-to-2015">reconciliation data published by the
            Department of Health for the years from 2012-13 onwards</a></p><hr /><br /></div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    The shape of the graph is familiar: the purple dotted line at the top represents NHS England’s “do nothing” scenario, where unit costs simply rise in line
    with inflation (around 3% a year from 2015-16 onwards) because providers make no efficiencies to mitigate it. The blue dashed line towards the bottom shows
    the NHS’s total available resources – made up of its core budget and then topped up by the £2 billion to £3.4 billion a year Sustainability and
    Transformation Fund (S&amp;TF), which we will discuss more later. The gap of almost a fifth between the two by 2020-21 is close to £22 billion – the
    original “NHS funding gap” highlighted in NHS England’s Five Year Forward View (FYFV).
</p>
<p>
    The bad news though is that it isn’t £22 billion, it is £23 billion: sharp eyes may notice the provider cost lines do not start at 100, but at just under
    101. That is to account for the £600m underlying provider deficit in 2013-14, which entails that the baseline cost of NHS services in 2013-14 was £600m (or
    0.7%) more than implied by NHS England’s original calculations.
</p>
<p>
    Time then for some good news: since the calculation of that £22 billion gap three years ago, NHS England has revised down its estimate of average annual
    NHS provider inflation from 2015-16 onwards, from 3% to 2.5% – largely to reflect the effect of continued public sector pay restraint announced in 2015.
    Our purple dashed line factors that revision into the “do nothing” cost forecast. It reduces the gap to £19 billion – the £4 billion difference making up
    part of the “central savings” claimed by NHS England towards the total £22 billion/£23 billion target.

</p>
<p>
    There is further good news: things may be bad for NHS providers, but we do not (yet) live in a world where hospitals and other services do not make any
    year-on-year efficiency savings. The green line in the middle shows provider costs after recurrent provider efficiencies of 2% a year – around the level of
    year-on-year efficiencies achieved in recent years, and the level of annual cost cuts providers will now need to keep making if they are to keep up with
    the 2% real terms cut to tariff prices each year.
</p>
<p>
    It looks like those 2% annual provider efficiencies save a lot – and they do: around £16 billion a year by 2020-21 compared to the “do nothing” scenario.
</p>
<p>
    But here is our problem: even after those 2% cost savings, year on year, the gap between the provider costs (green line) and the total NHS budget gets
    progressively wider from 2018-19 onwards. By 2020-21 it reaches 2.1% of total available resources, indicating a £2.5 billion net deficit in the NHS budget.
</p>
<p>
    And then there is the question of the S&amp;TF. That £2 billion to £3.4 billion a year fund was announced as part of the 2015 Spending Review and is
    supposed to fund investment in much needed service transformation; to secure the long term sustainability of NHS services and to deliver the new models of
    care set out in the FYFV. But here we see it swallowed up just funding the annual increases in day to day activity; nothing is spare for investment. The
    solid blue line at the bottom of the graph shows the core budget would be without the S&amp;TF: heading straight for a £6 billion NHS-wide deficit by
    2020-21.
</p>
<p>
    This is the backdrop against which NHS England, NHS Improvement and most particularly the Treasury are demanding two further changes from local NHS
    organisations: from providers, they want to see additional efficiencies, above and beyond the 2% they have achieved in recent years; and from commissioners
    they hope to see a full percentage point reduction in the speed at which the volume of care provided by the NHS is growing.
</p>
<p>
    To explore the likely impact of those further efficiencies and spending reductions it is useful now to shift away from the NHS England budget as a whole to
    look more specifically and in cash terms at the secondary care sector, which makes up approximately 72% of the NHS commissioning budget, and from where the
    vast bulk of NHS England’s estimated £15 billion of “locally delivered” savings will come.

<h2>Zoom in on secondary care: sharing the pain of 5 more years of deficits?</h2>
<p>Graph 3.2 below presents the secondary care-only version of the £22bn funding gap. The core secondary care budget (solid blue line) is set at 72 per cent of NHS England’s resource budget – a figure taken from the modelling behind the NHS England’s Five Year Forward View – while the blue dashed line supplements that by adding the entire S&TF</p>
<p>You can read more about our workings on this here. <input type="button" onClick="growDiv2()" value="+" id="more-button2"></p><div id='grow2'>
    <div class='measuringWrapper2'>
    <div class="text"><hr />
    <p>To model the affordability or otherwise of rising secondary care activity we have first defined “secondary care” as all hospital (general and specialist), community (including continuing healthcare) and mental health activity. NHS England’s recent briefing paper on the modelling behind the Five Year Forward View showed how core spending on this area accounted for £69bn of NHS England’s total spending in 2014-15, or 71 per cent. Apportioning a 71 per cent share of the additional £2bn combined cost of other NHS England “commitment pressure” spending  and health spending in the military and justice systems to “secondary care” gave a  total baseline for secondary care spending for that year of £70.2bn, or 72 per cent of NHS England’s resource allocation. We have used that 72 per cent figure to extrapolate an NHS secondary care commissioning budget from 2013-14 to 2020-21. To calculate the figure for the years from 2016-17 onwards (where the full NHS England budget is supplemented by the ring fenced S&TF) we have calculated first a “core” secondary care budget as 72 per cent of NHS England’s total planned spending for each year, minus planned S&TF spending, as set out in its November 2015 board paper detailing financial allocations. Our S&TF enhanced figure for secondary care then includes the entire STF for that year, rather than a 72 per cent proportion, as we believe it most likely that the vast bulk of the S&TF will be spent in secondary care. No adjustment is made to reflect NHS transfers to local authority social care spending under the Better Care Fund, or to reflect the 1 per cent non-recurrent spending and 0.5 per cent contingency requirements set by NHS England.</p> <hr /><br />
    </div>    </div> </div>
<p>A slightly lower rate of activity increase is shown here (2.9 percent a year rather than 3.07 percent) as this echoes NHS England’s assumption for activity growth in the sector in the years until 2020-21 (the overall growth rate is pushed up to 3.07 per cent by an expected increase in community prescribing activity of just under 5 per cent a year).
</p><p>Our headline starting “gap” here is the £15bn gap between the secondary care budget (including the full S&TF) and the cost of providing activity with no additional efficiencies since 2013-14 (shown again by the purple line). This is analogous to what NHS England refers to as the local share of the £22bn funding gap, or productivity challenge. Provider efficiencies of 2 per cent a year would reduce that gap by £9.4bn to leave a secondary care-wide deficit of £1.8bn in 2020-21 [fn on why this £9.4bn is more than NHS E 8.5bn fig] – but only after it had absorbed the entire S&TF on funding the cost of the growing volume of day-to-day care.
</p>
<p>The core secondary care budget without the S&TF is shown by the solid blue line. Our analysis shows that without the S&TF, the secondary care deficit would be £5.2bn by 2020-21. That is the stubborn end of the £15bn funding gap that is now causing sleepless nights amongst commissioners and providers in the secondary care sector.
</p>
<blockquote>Even if providers make 2 percent cost savings a year, the amount they will get paid under the tariff will be cut by an equal amount, and so the level of their deficit will remain similar in proportion to what it is today – reaching around £3.7bn by 2020-21.</blockquote>
<p>We can get a sense of how commissioners and providers are sharing the pain of that £5.2bn funding gap by looking now at how much the growing quantity of secondary care would cost commissioners. This is shown by our red line, which prices up the expected volume of care by the NHS tariff to show the price that will need to be paid to providers by commissioners. 
</p><p>At no point does it meet the actual cost of providing care – that much we know: Even if providers make 2 percent cost savings a year, the amount they will get paid under the tariff will be cut by an equal amount, and so the level of their deficit will remain similar in proportion to what it is today – reaching around £3.7bn by 2020-21.
</p><p>The bigger change, as discussed above, will be for commissioners. The gradual modest cash increases in tariff prices, combined with the growing volume of care purchased, means that from 2018-19 onwards, the core secondary care budget would be insufficient to cover commissioner tariff bills, forcing them to dip ever further into the S&TF to pay for the day to day costs of secondary care. 
</p><p>By 2019-20, over a third of the S&TF would be needed to subsidise commissioner costs under the tariff, while the remaining £2bn or so would be absorbed in provider deficits. No S&TF would be available for investment in “service transformation”. The underling £5.2bn deficit against the core commissioning budget would be formed of a £3.7bn deficit in provider accounts and a £1.5bn overspend by commissioners. 
<div id="chart4-2"></div>
<h2>Increase provider efficiency free up investment for transformation?</h2>
<p>We saw earlier that the £3.5bn underlying provider deficit in 2015-16 was testament to the redundancy of relying almost exclusively on high levels of provider cost saving to curtail NHS spending. Indeed, Lord Carter’s report on hospital efficiency published earlier this year looked extensively at the opportunities for further cost savings in acute hospitals to 2020 and found a rate of just 2 percent could be expected: half the rate required of hospitals in recent years.
</p><p>Nevertheless, secondary care providers are now been asked to exceed that. The rationale is simply that without further efficiencies from providers, the entire S&TF will be dwindled to naught.
</p><p>The need for a higher level of efficiency was implicit in the original “control total” set for the provider sector for 2016-17. This commanded that secondary care providers needed to end 2016-17 with an underlying deficit of £1.8bn, down from £3.5bn in 2015-16. That would entail a 3.8 percent cut in costs in 2016-17, and the same again in 2017-18, to get the provider deficit down to around £500m a year.
</p><p>By the end of June 2016 however, it had become apparent that such a level of cost reduction (almost twice the rate achieved in recent years) was not realistic, resulting in an easing (or “re-set”) of the control total to an underlying deficit for 2016-17 of £2.35bn (which will be reported in provider accounts as a deficit of £0.55bn, after the absorption to their bottom lines of £1.8bn of “sustainability” funding).
</p><p>Meeting that re-set target will require providers to make an extra 1.1 per cent recurrent efficiency saving, over and above the 2 percent already planned (and required by the tariff). Providers will need to make that level of efficiency for at least three years if they are to come close to bringing their costs into line with the income they receive under the tariff. 
</p><p>Graph 3.3 shows the impact that extra “re-set” efficiency would have on provider costs, assuming it was achieved for three years in a row from 2016-17, with recurrent efficiency savings returning to 2 per cent from 2019-20 onwards. (To make viewing easier, we have dispensed with the purple “do nothing” lines. Doing nothing, after all, is not a plausible option).
Graph 3.3


</p><p>As graph 3.3 shows, three years of recurrent efficiency savings at just over 3 per cent (that is, over a third higher than the rate achieved since 2013-14) would bring provider costs almost in line with the payments due to them under the tariff by 2018-19 (although our “almost” here is relative: providers would still be left with an annual trading deficit of around £600m).  That would bring provider costs down to under the level of the total budget (after it had been supplemented with the S&TF) and reduce the secondary care deficit against its core budget in 2020-21 from £5.2bn to £2.2bn. 
</p><p>Crucially, the extra provider efficiency would remove the need for very large “sustainability” payments to providers from 2018-19 onwards, freeing up part of the S&TF for investment instead in transformation.
</p><p>What it would not do, however, is reduce core tariff costs for commissioners, on whose side the bulk of the £2.2bn core deficit would then sit. That is because provider efficiency does nothing – at least in the short term – to reduce tariff bills for commissioners, which are determined by the volume of care purchased. Commissioners would still be left unable to pay their tariff bills out of their core budgets from 2019-20, and would instead need to use almost two thirds of the STF just to fund recurrent activity under the tariff. The pain of the core £2.2bn deficit, then, rest predominantly (£1.5bn worth) with commissioners. 
</p><p>Beside from the begging bowl outside the Treasury, that leaves commissioners with nowhere else to turn but to reduce the rate at which activity levels are growing.
</p><p>We are in the realm of theory rather than evidence-based practice here, but it is worth considering what the impact on secondary care costs would be if the modest amounts of S&TF freed up through extra provider efficiencies were invested in measures to reduce the speed at which activity levels were growing. 
</p><p>Chart 1 below shows how much S&TF would be available for genuine investment in service transformation in each of the five years to 2020-21 if, and only if, providers managed to find three years of 3 per cent recurrent efficiencies. 

</p><p>While the vast bulk of the S&TF would be eaten up by provider deficits in 2016-17, around £1.6bn (still only around half of the headline £2.9bn amount) would, in theory, be available for investment in 2017-18. Somewhat paradoxically, 2018-19 (the year the NHS as a whole is set to receive its lowest real terms funding increase) would emerge as the year with the most significant investment fund for transformation, at around £2bn. After that, the continued rise in secondary care activity would again require the bulk of the S&TF to be used to fund the cost of that recurrent demand, as commissioner tariff bills exceeded their core budgets.
</p><p>There is very little systematic evidence on the scale and cost effectiveness of investment in demand management, but it is NHS England’s hope that investment in early diagnosis, better primary care and improved patient self-management, for example, will serve to improve population health and therefore slow the pace of activity growth by around one percentage point: from 2.9 per cent activity growth a year in secondary care to 1.9 per cent.
</p><p>As we have seen, substantial funds will not be available for investment in that transformation until 2017-18. It therefore does not seem plausible to expect any real change in the activity growth rate until after then. Graph 3.4 then models the impact on secondary care costs of a staged 1 percentage point reduction in the activity growth rate over the three years from 2018-19 to 2020-21.
 Graph 3.4


</p><p>It is a big ask, but graph 3.4 perhaps shows why NHS England is banking on the twin hopes of substantial extra provider efficiencies in the first instance, followed by commissioner investment to achieve a percentage point reduction in the rate at which activity is growing. 
</p><p>The impact of this strategy, if successful, is shown by the green and red dotted lines above. The annual saving in provider costs (green line) – above “extra” efficiencies alone – would be in the order of £1.7bn by 2020-21. That would imply a rather heroic and rapid return on any transformational investment, for which there is little or no evidence base. Yet it is only after both those changes – provider efficiency in excess of 3 percent, for three years, combined with a 1 percentage point reduction in activity growth - that commissioners will be able to meet the cost of the activity from their core budgets, and providers nudge close (although still around £500m off) covering their costs.
</p><p>That’s a lot of ifs, which leave us asking: what if those extra efficiencies were not forthcoming in the three years from 2016-17? After all, the current size of the provider deficit is testament to the inability of providers to make similarly scaled cost savings over the last three years. 
<h2>Rationing without investment</h2>
<p>It is not a palatable scenario, but, as we have seen, without additional provider efficiencies, there can be no S&TF. And with no S&TF there can be no investment in genuinely reducing the rate at which demand is growing by improving population health. The risk is then that commissioners resort instead to curtailing growth by through service rationing. They might do this directly – by raising the threshold for treatment and access to certain services – or they might attempt to do it indirectly, by shutting services and hoping that patient expectations for care and treatment will wane, rather than simply divert to alternative services elsewhere.  
</p><p>Beside from the ethical, political and long term health implications of such a move, how viable would it be as a cost saving measure in the short term?
</p><p>The current secondary care activity growth rate of just under 3 per cent a year is comprised of 1.5 per cent growth due to population growth and aging and the remaining 1.5 per cent growth due to so-called “non-demographic growth” which is the pressure to increase activity levels due to factors such as rising public expectations (for example, that X condition will be treated, rather than endured) improvements in quality and clinical advancements.
</p><p>Reducing the rate of activity growth to below the 1.5 per cent driven by population growth and change would involve drastic measures: it would effectively mean denying today’s 72 year olds the same hip replacement their 75 year old neighbours received last year. But commissioners might,  in the absence of sufficient investment funds, be tempted to make in-roads into the remaining 1.5 per cent of growth which we could loosely term as driven by improvements in quality and access. 
</p><p>Graph 3.5 below shows the impact (in solid lines) of the same staged reduction in the activity growth rate to 1.9 per cent explored above, but with provider efficiencies “only” at 2 per cent a year. As the graph shows, attempting to balance the NHS budget through a 1 percentage point reduction in activity alone is not a viable option: It simply would not save enough cash and the entire S&TF would still be needed to bail out provider deficits for the rest of the decade.
Graph 3.5
</p><p>Bringing the NHS into financial balance without provider efficiencies in excess of 2 percent a year and concomitant successful commissioner investment in reducing growth in demand would then only be achievable were the rate of activity growth slashed even further - to the 1.5 percent required to meet only that element of demand driven by demographic change. 
</p><p>Doing that, as the dotted lines on graph 3.5 shows, would bring provider costs down to below the level of the total budget (after spending all of the S&TF). But this precarious balance would be achieved at the cost of preserving the NHS in aspic: Standing still and deliberately halting any further advancement in healthcare quality, such as the adoption of new treatments available elsewhere in the developed world. 
</p><p>That is a scenario most will want to avoid. But another “if” has crept into our analysis: avoiding the need to balance budgets through crude rationing and quality stagnation is not just dependent on providers finding levels of efficiencies that have evaded them over recent years. It will require commissioners to use any investment funds freed up by that efficiency successfully – to genuinely reduce the demand for health services rather than simply slash its supply. However the evidence for achieving that – particularly over just a four year timescale - is limited.

            financial distress. That support was provided in the form of revenue injections which flattered the reported deficit between provider income and

            NHS England’s calculations suggest a saving from the pay cap of nearer £5 billion. However this was calculated prior to the announcement at Budget
            2016 of a change in the public sector pension discount rate which we estimate will increase the pension cost of NHS employers by around 1% from
            2019-20 onwards, reducing the central savings on the NHS pay budget from £5 billion to £4 billion.

            To model the affordability or otherwise of rising secondary care activity we have first defined “secondary care” as all hospital (general and
            specialist), community (including continuing healthcare) and mental health activity. <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fyfv-tech-note-090516.pdf">NHS England’s recent briefing paper on the modelling behind
            the Five Year Forward View</a> showed how core spending in this area accounted for £69 billion (or 71%) of NHS England’s total spending in 2014-15. A
            further £2 billion worth of NHS’s England spending that year is categorised in the paper as “commitment pressure” and as military and justice
            system spending. Assuming that 71% of that spending was made in the secondary care sector brings the combined total secondary care spend to £70.2
            billion, or 72% of NHS England’s resource allocation. We have used that 72% figure to extrapolate an NHS secondary care commissioning budget from
            2013-14 to 2020-21. To calculate the figure for the years from 2016-17 onwards (where the full NHS England budget is supplemented by the ring
            fenced S&amp;TF) we have calculated first a “core” secondary care budget as 72% of NHS England’s total planned spending for each year, minus
            planned S&amp;TF spending, as set out in <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04.PB_.17.12.15-Allocations.pdf">NHS England’s December 2015 board paper detailing financial allocations</a>. Our S&amp;TF enhanced figure for
            secondary care then includes the entire S&amp;TF for that year, rather than a 72% proportion, as we believe it most likely that the vast bulk of
            the S&amp;TF will be spent in secondary care. No adjustment is made to reflect NHS transfers to local authority social care spending under the
            Better Care Fund, or to reflect the 1% non-recurrent spending and 0.5% contingency requirements set by NHS England.

            If delivered, the £2.35 billion underlying deficit in 2016-17 would be reported in provider accounts as a deficit of £550m, with the remaining £1.8
            billion in deficit offset by extra non-recurrent income from the Sustainability and Transformation Fund.

            A simple example of this would be where a provider has already covered the fixed costs of providing a service and so caring for additional patients
            only entails the marginal cost of each extra patient – i.e. the medicines and devices consumed in their care and the additional costs of providing
            clinical staff time.
